# Danny Ford Portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio! 
#### Some of the projects above have been what I have created based from study drills encouraged by the 'Learn Python the Hard Way' Book I have mentioned in my CV or from my own initiative.
#### Although I still want to work on some of these projects some more, to fix bugs and improve the user experience, I am proud with how far I have come from a self-taught background and am enthusiastic to share my development thus far. 

#### I have also include the files for my time when I was looking into web devloping as I wanted to intergrate what I was learning into my note taking so it would stay in my mind by taking aciton immediately
